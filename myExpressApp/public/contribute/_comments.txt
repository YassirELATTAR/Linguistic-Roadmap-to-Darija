dataset that users will be uploading their xml files to contribute to the database. It shows the different categories 
available in each dataset. In the next section, the instructions are included for users to contribute their contributions.

'sentences', in their respective pages, and the example section would show the user an example of how their xml files should 
look like. Users can then select a file from their devices, and upload the file. The script in 'grammarjavascript.js' file

files, and the users can submit their file after if the validation is successful.
